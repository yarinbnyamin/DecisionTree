<h1 align="center">ID3 Decision Tree and Bagging Implementation from Scratch</h2>
<p align="center">

This project involves implementing the ID3 decision tree algorithm from scratch and the bagging algorithm and evaluating their performance.

The tasks include:

1. Computing entropy at a node.
2. Splitting the dataset at a node based on a given feature.
3. Calculating information gain from splitting on a given feature.
4. Selecting the feature that maximizes information gain.
5. Building a decision tree classifier (MyID3) compatible with scikit-learn.
6. Implementing a bagging algorithm (MyBaggingID3) using MyID3 as the base classifier.
7. Evaluating the performance of these implementations.
